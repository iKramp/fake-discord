# nebula
A platform similar to discord, written in rust. It aims to replicate the chat experience with some additional features and without clutter. 
It will have an elegant and simple intuitive ui without lacking all needed features. Its main focus is to be fast, lightweight, secure and 
efficient. 
Discord is written in javascipt and ran on a glorified browser on the desktop app, which is horribly slow. Nebula will be written in rust and 
compiled
which should be faster and consume less battery, maybe it will be even available as a web version :)

This is a project for a few people to learn some useful programming principles like managing a database, creating a good and usable UI and more, while creating a usable and working chatting app. 
It is heavily inspired by discord and will contain text chats, voice chats, a system similar to discord servers, permissions and so on
